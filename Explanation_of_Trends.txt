Data insights:
1) More urban areas have more drivers
2) The average rural driver provides the most rides, and those are the most expensive rides.
This is evident in the pie charts.
Only 1% of drivers are rural, but they provide 5.2% of all rides, and 6.6% of revenue
3) From the bubble chart:
There is a negative correlation between the number of rides in a given city, and the average fare in that city.
This could be because, more urban areas represent shorter rides, but more rides.
It could also be because areas where there are fewer rides given have a smaller supply of drivers,
so prices are "surging" due to low supply or drivers.
